A one-day workshop on Pythonâ€™s main Scientific libraries (Scipy, Numpy, Matplotlib and Pandas), covering how to link existing C and Fortran codes within Python code.

This material is provided by the [Research Computing Team](https://arcleeds.github.io) at the [University of Leeds](https://www.leeds.ac.uk).

## Content

This workshop is aimed at people who want to learn how to use Python for Scientific Computing tasks. The workshop will give an introduction to Python's main Scientific libraries (Scipy, Numpy, Matplotlib and Pandas) and will also cover how to link existing C and Fortran codes and subroutines within your Python code. All exercises will use Python 3. This would be an ideal course to attend before *High Performance Python*.

## Prerequisites

This workshop is aimed at people who can already program in Python at an intermediate level (with a knowledge of loops, functions and `if` statements). If you need to learn how to program in Python, please attend *SWD1a: Introduction to Python programming*.
